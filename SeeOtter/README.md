Due to constraints imposed by this version of github, it was not possible to upload the entire contents of directory SeeOtter\torch.
In particular, there are two files inside SeeOtter\torch\lib that failed.
As a workaround, directory 'lib' was compressed into file 'lib.zip'.

Therefore, in order to fully use the application, after downloading, the user must extract the contents of 'lib.zip' to restore the directory structure. The 'lib.zip' contents should be the 'lib' directory, and should be placed inside torch:
SeeOtter\torch\lib
